<h1>WiFi Jammer using ESP8266</h1>
<p>This project shows how to build a WiFi jammer using an ESP8266 board. A WiFi jammer is a device that can disrupt or block WiFi signals from other devices. This can be used for testing and educational purposes, but also for malicious attacks.</p>
<p>The main feature of this project is the deauthentication attack, which can disconnect devices from their WiFi network by sending fake deauthentication packets. This attack works on most 2.4GHz WiFi networks and devices, unless they use WiFi 6 or other security measures.</p>

<p>The project uses an ESP8266 board with NodeMCU firmware, which can be programmed using Arduino IDE. The board also has a web interface that allows you to scan for WiFi networks and devices, select targets, create fake networks, and control the jamming process.</p>
